*Teacher: Alban Gaignard (alban.gaignard@univ-nantes.fr)*

No background is required, please interact between participants and with teacher/helper. 

## Agenda
This session is planned Wednesday, the 31st of March at 9h30, for 3 hours with the following agenda: 
 - 9h30-10h30: introduction and applications of Knowledge Graphs for Life Sciences  
 - 10h30-11h30: RDF and SPARQL 
 - 11h30-12h30: LS ontologies and application in the context gene regulation networks

## Practical instructions 
Most of the hands-on sessions can be realized with online web resources/interfaces. 
Pen and paper will also be very important to draw knowledge graphs and draft graph patterns.   

A basic python environment is enough to code. A convenient way of setting it up is to configure a conda environment. 
As soon as `conda` is installed on your machine, use the following commands to install `RDFlib` and `Jupyter` packages. 
```
conda create --name dubii python=3.7 rdflib jupyter -c conda-forge
```

If you have troubles with `conda`, click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DU-Bii/module-6-Integrative-Bioinformatics/HEAD?filepath=%2Fcurrent%2Fsession3). This will launch a "virtual machine" on the cloud and give you an interactive Jupyter environment. 

See you soon on Wednesday 31/03 at 9:30 !
