[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DU-Bii/module-6-Integrative-Bioinformatics/master?filepath=2020%2Fsession4)

*Teacher: Alban Gaignard (alban.gaignard@univ-nantes.fr)*

No background is required, please interact between participants and with teacher/helper. 

## Agenda
This session is planned Tuesday, the 9th of May at 14h, for 3 hours with the following agenda: 
 - 14h-15h: introduction and applications of Knowledge Graphs for Life Sciences  
 - 15h-16h: RDF and SPARQL 
 - 16h-17h: LS ontologies and application in the context gene regulation networks

## Practical instructions 
Most of the hands-on sessions can be realized with online web resources/interfaces. 
Pen and paper will also be very important to draw knowledge graphs and draft graph patterns.   

A basic python environment is enough to code. A convenient way of setting it up is to configure a conda environment. 
As soon as `conda` is installed on your machine, use the following commands to install `RDFlib` and `Jupyter` packages. 
```
conda create --name dubii python=3.7 rdflib jupyter -c conda-forge
```

If you have troubles with `conda`, click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DU-Bii/module-6-Integrative-Bioinformatics/master?filepath=2020%2Fsession4). This will launch a "virtual machine" on the cloud and give you an interactive Jupyter environment. 

See you soon on Tuesday 09/05 at 14:00 !
