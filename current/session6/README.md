### Session 6: Network Inference

*Teachers: Costas Bouyioukos*

- Course: Network inference with the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis.
    - Video introduction to gene regulation: [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ikACMbbxE&feature=youtu.be&t=2250).
    - Video Course: [Cours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f6UubLLoUk) Untill 34:15.
    - Slides Course: [slides](../../2020/session5/WGCNA_seance5.pdf).

- Practical with the WGCNA R-Bioconductor package: Basics on correlation, matrices and network sciences.
    1. You have to install, before hand, the WGCNA R-Bioconductor package. If you alredy have Bioconductor installed then a simple command like `BiocManager::install("WGCNA")` will do all the job for you. If you do not have Bioconductor installed please follow the installation guide on [Bioconductor\_Installation](http://bioconductor.org/install/).
    2. A long  document containing all the synthesis of the TP from the WGCNA tutorials can be found here [Tutorials WGCNA](../../2020/session5/prerequisites/)
    3. Data: All the required data to run the practical can be found by pressing here [data](../../2020/session5/data/)
    4. Practical: The handout of the TP with only the code is here [Handout](Network_Inference_with_WGCNA.pdf)
    5. Video practical: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f6UubLLoUk&t=2054) From 34:15 untill the end
